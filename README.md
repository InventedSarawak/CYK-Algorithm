# 🚀 CYK Algorithm Implementation

An efficient C implementation of the **Cocke–Younger–Kasami (CYK)** algorithm — a classic dynamic programming technique to determine if a given string belongs to a **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** in **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF)**. Whether you're parsing grammars or diving into compiler theory, this project has you covered 💡📚

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📥 **Input-friendly**: Parses grammar rules from standard input
- ✅ **CNF Check**: Converts grammar to CNF if not already in CNF
- 📊 **Parse Table Output**: Displays the parsing matrix step-by-step
- 🔍 **Membership Test**: Checks if a string can be generated by the grammar

## ⚙️ Build & Run

1. Clone the repository and compile using the provided Makefile:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd CYK_Algorithm
make
```

2. a. To run the program after building on Unix-like systems:

```bash
./bin/cyk_algorithm.exe
```

2. b. To run the program on Windows using Docker:

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t cyk-algorithm .

# Run interactively
docker run -it cyk-algorithm

# Or run with input from a file
docker run -i cyk-algorithm < your_input_file.txt
```

3. To clean up build files:

```bash
make clean
```

## 🧾 Sample Grammar Input Format

```
S -> AB | BC
A -> BA | a
B -> CC | b
C -> AB | a
```

*All grammar rules should strictly be in CNF.*

---

## 💻 Example Usage

Given grammar and input string:

```
Enter number of productions: 4
Enter productions:
S -> AB
A -> a
B -> b
Enter input string: ab
```

Expected output:

```
✅ The string *ab* is derivable from the given grammar.
```
